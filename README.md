# Comprehensive E-commerce Sales and User Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains an analytical project focused on e-commerce data to identify sales trends, user behavior patterns, and key factors influencing revenue.
The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights that can assist in making informed business decisions.

## Data Source

The data for this analysis was obtained from 'data-analytics-mate' via an SQL query.
It includes key metrics such as: `order_date`, `session_date`, `price`, `account_id`, `is_verified`, `is_unsubscribed`, `device`, `traffic_source`, `product_category`, `country`, `continent`, `operating_system`, etc.

## Tools and Technologies

* **Google Colab / Python:** Used for data preparation, cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis.
    * Key libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
* **Tableau Public:** Utilized for interactive data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Repository Structure

* `Comprehensive_E-commerce_Sales_and_User_Behavior_Analysis.ipynb`: The main Google Colab notebook containing all the code for data preparation, analysis, and initial visualizations.
* `Comprehensive E-commerce Sales and User Behavior Analysis.twbx`: Tableau Packaged Workbook, which includes an interactive dashboard with all visualizations.

## Analysis and Insights

This project explores:
* **Key Sales and User Metrics:** Analysis of fundamental sales figures and user characteristics.
* **Sales Dynamics:** Examination of how sales metrics evolve over time.
* **Pivot Tables and Aggregated Metrics:** Utilization of summarized data to highlight important trends and totals.
* **Statistical Analysis of Relationships:** Investigation into the correlations and connections between different variables.
* **Statistical Analysis of Differences Between Groups:** Comparison of metrics across various user segments or categories to identify significant variations.

Key insights include:
* A significant portion of revenue originates from users in the United States and the Americas.
* The percentage of verified users is significantly higher than that of unverified users.
* The analysis revealed statistically significant positive correlations across all examined pairs.
